# IDCrash

This is a Python script that combines psypanda's **hashID** and **hashcat** functionality.

It's likely full of bugs, so use at your own risk, but it should be useful for CTF events and the like.

Simply enter your hash and the program will try all hashcat options that hashID delegates to it until it cracks a hash, or runs out of options.

To test functionality, try hashing "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"


##### Credit goes to **psypanda** and the **hashcat team** for two great programs that are used in this script.
